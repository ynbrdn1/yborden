Part 1:
Using "ros2 node list":
    /av1broadcaster
    /av2broadcaster
    /plots_publisher_node
    /rviz2_node
    /transform_listener_impl_aaab079c8260

Part 2:
    0. Open four terminals and in all four:
        cd ~/ae740_ws
        source install/setup.bash

    In four seperate terminals run the following commands:     
    1. ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 1 0 0 0 0 0 world av1 --ros-args --remap __node:=av1broadcaster
    2. ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 0 0 1 0 0 0 world av2 --ros-args --remap __node:=av2broadcaster
    3. ros2 run two_drones_pkg plots_publisher_node
    4. ros2 run rviz2 rviz2 -d $(ros2 pkg prefix --share two_drones_pkg)/config/default.rviz --ros-args --remap __node:=rviz2_node

Part 3:
    /av1broadcaster publishes to /tf
    /av2broadcaster publishes to /tf
    /plots_publisher_node subscribes to /tf and publishes to /visuals
    /transform_listener_impl_aaab079c8260 subscribes to /tf
    /av1broadcaster is responsible for av1 and frames
    /av2broadcaster is responsible for av2 and frames
    the \visuals topic is the one responsible for the drone meshes

Part 4:
    If we omit the "static:=True" parameter, the launch file uses the default value "False". 
    Therefore, the /av1broadcaster and /av2broadcaster nodes are not launched, while the /frames_publisher_node is run.
    As a result, we do not see the coordinate frames associated with the drones in rviz, since there is nothing publishing to the /tf topic.
    We also have an additional node /frames_publisher_node, which doesn't subscribe to or publish to any topics, so it doesn't affect anything.
